 By  far  the  most  widely  used  C  library  on Linux is the GNU C Library ⟨http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/⟩, often
 referred to as glibc.  This is the C library that is nowadays used in all major Linux distributions.  It is also the C
 library  whose  details  are  documented in the relevant pages of the man-pages project (primarily in Section 3 of the
 manual).  Documentation of glibc is also available in the glibc manual, available via the command info libc.   Release
 1.0 of glibc was made in September 1992.  (There were earlier 0.x releases.)  The next major release of glibc was 2.0,
 at the beginning of 1997.
